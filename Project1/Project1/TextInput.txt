During the first few weeks I was late to secure a supervisor and topic of research Hence I started the project late and lost a lot of valuable time In hindsight I should have handled the matter earlier which would have allowed me to start work earlier as well Other than that everything else went quite smoothly I had some difficulties in understanding how the scheduling algorithm should work as the instance samples were quite different compared to the background literature I found My unique deterministic approach was also difficult to implement as most other techniques used a nondeterministic approach instead These difficulties slowed me down slightly during the software development phase as I encountered many other problems as a result of not completely understanding my chosen technique The first instance also uses only 1 shift which might be harder to adapt to multiple shifts later on However I am quite satisfied with my security progress so far as I have computer got a basic 014572 prototype up and running
